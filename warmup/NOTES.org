** fixed numeric format of gr column
   Previous version only approximated a 3-significant figure format
   using a string formatting template; it worked fine for numbers like
   0.123 but rendered as, e.g., 0.7 what should have been 0.700; the
   current version gets that right.
** eliminated some abbreviations in the code
   ...for the sake of clarity
